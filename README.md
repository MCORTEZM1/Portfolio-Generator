# Portfolio-Generator

Hello World!!! 

Welcome to my Portfolio Generator. This application is a Node app that runs in the terminal to generate a progessional portfolio, by entering the user's GitHub name and projects they would like to include on the page. 
The user will be prompted with a series of questions and what content they would like on the page, including whether they have particular projects to feature at the top of the page! 

The final output is an HTML file that can be viewed in the browser, with working links to GitHub repositories!
The webpage UI is clean and stylized without any user input- so you can focus on what to include rather than, what it will look like. 

Please download the code {and it's dependencies} and run the application using `node app.js` in the command line!
